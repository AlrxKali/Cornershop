# Business Intelligence Case

This report has the following parts:

1. A SQL document in which we run queries to answer business-related questions
2. A HTML document in which we explain how we estimate the time
4. A tableau document in which we used the data from the SQL and python analysis to get BI
5. A report in which we summarize the finding. 

We recommend following the order of files, as shown above, for a better understanding of the analysis process.
